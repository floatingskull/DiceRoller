Quick and simple dice rolling program for Arduino with an LCD shield.

Instructions will pop up when you run the program on the LCD shield.  It's pretty simple. Rolling actual dice is more fun, to be honest, but I wanted to practice programming for the LCD shield, and this seemed like as good a project as any.
